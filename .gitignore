# ASSET EXCLUSIONS FOR PORTFOLIO (CUSTOM)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This section ensures that all large assets are excluded, leaving only code.

# 1. Exclude all files and subfolders within Assets
/Assets/*

# 2. RE-INCLUDE REQUIRED FOLDERS (Structure)
# Re-include the main structure folders so Git can track the hierarchy.
# Important: Git only tracks files, so we need to re-include specific files/types later.
!/Assets/*/

# 3. RE-INCLUDE CODE AND CONFIGURATION FILES (What you want to show)

# Re-include C# scripts and their essential meta files
!/Assets/**/*.cs
!/Assets/**/*.cs.meta

# Re-include Shader files and their meta files
!/Assets/**/*.shader
!/Assets/**/*.shader.meta

# Re-include Assembly Definition Files (.asmdef)
!/Assets/**/*.asmdef
!/Assets/**/*.asmdef.meta

# Re-include Text files, Markdown files, or other documentation you might have
!/Assets/**/*.txt
!/Assets/**/*.md
!/Assets/**/*.json

# Re-include Prefabs and Scenes (Only to show structure/hierarchy, though they won't work without assets)
# Prefabs and Scenes often contain important links and logic structure.
!/Assets/**/*.prefab
!/Assets/**/*.prefab.meta
!/Assets/**/*.unity
!/Assets/**/*.unity.meta

# 4. EXPLICITLY EXCLUDE LARGE ASSET TYPES (Ensure they are not re-included)
# Even if the whole folder is excluded, this adds extra safety.

/Assets/**/*.mat            # Materials
/Assets/**/*.fbx            # Models
/Assets/**/*.obj            # Models
/Assets/**/*.blend          # Models (Blender)
/Assets/**/*.png            # Textures
/Assets/**/*.jpg            # Textures
/Assets/**/*.tga            # Textures
/Assets/**/*.wav            # Sounds
/Assets/**/*.mp3            # Sounds
/Assets/**/*.ogg            # Sounds
